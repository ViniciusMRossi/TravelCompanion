# Implementation Status

Keep this short. This is not an SDD.

## Phase 0 — Foundation

- [x] Repository structure
- [x] Gradle/Kotlin/Compose baseline
- [x] Field Companion token scaffold
- [x] Navigation shell
- [x] Packaged starter `trip.json`
- [x] Starter typed trip loader/repository
- [x] Participant identity via DataStore
- [x] Group sync boundary / no-op implementation
- [x] Confirm Gradle sync on developer machine
- [x] Confirm unit tests
- [x] Confirm debug APK
- [ ] Confirm starter on emulator/device
- [ ] Add Room when structured runtime persistence is first needed

Phase 0 required two baseline corrections before it would build; see D006 and
D007 in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Phase 1 — Approved visual foundation

Implemented from the approved prototype, **not yet verified running**.

- [x] 01 Quem é você?
- [x] 02 Hoje
- [x] 05 Atração
- [x] Shared Field Companion components
- [x] Full `trip.schema.json` projection + `TripContent` lookups
- [x] `AssetResolver` with placeholder fallback
- [x] Today domain layer (current day, Now/Next, timeline state, critical items)
- [x] Field Companion icon set converted from the approved sprite
- [ ] Fraunces binary (still the serif fallback — D005)
- [ ] Real photography (heroes render the approved striped placeholder)
- [ ] **Visual fidelity is unverified.** The app has never been run on a device
      or emulator in this environment (none available), so no claim of visual
      fidelity to the approved prototype has been confirmed by observation.
      Structure, geometry, colour and copy were implemented from the prototype
      source; only a device run can confirm the result.

## Phase 2 — Local audio

**Verified on hardware.** Samsung SM-S921B (Galaxy S24), Android 16 (API 36),
Media3 1.10.1, over ADB on 2026-09-03.

- [x] Media3/ExoPlayer in a `MediaSessionService`
- [x] `PlaybackController` separated from screens, application-scoped (D015)
- [x] Local audio resolved through `AssetResolver` as `asset:///` (D017)
- [x] Play / pause from the persistent compact player
- [x] Observable position and duration (`StateFlow<PlaybackState>`)
- [x] Position persisted per guide and restored on the next play
- [x] A finished guide replays from the start (D022)
- [x] Chapters tracked from position; the compact player names the current one
- [x] Screen 05 keeps its approved action; playback surfaces in the design
      system's persistent compact player (D020)
- [x] Notification/lock screen show the guide title and context, not an id
- [x] An unplayable guide never disturbs audio that is playing (D021)
- [x] No network and no group-sync dependency
- [x] Documented prototype audio placeholder so the flow can be exercised (D019)
- [x] **Verified on hardware** — see below
- [ ] **Seek is deferred to Phases 3/4** (approved). `seekTo` / `seekBy` exist
      on the controller and are unit-tested; the −15 / +15 transport belongs to
      screens 07 and 09. `TcAudioPlayerVariant.Full` implements it and waits.
- [ ] **Chapter selection is deferred to Phase 6** (approved). `seekToChapter` /
      `skipToNextChapter` exist and are unit-tested; the approved chapter list
      lives on screen 04 (Cidade).

### Confirmed by observation on the device

Each of these was watched on the Galaxy S24, with `dumpsys media_session`,
`dumpsys audio` and logcat as evidence. No crash, ANR or ExoPlayer/Media3
error appeared in any run.

- first playback after a cold start — audio ~1.3 s after the tap;
- playback surviving navigation between screens and root tabs;
- playback continuing with the screen off, held by
  `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK 'ExoPlayer:WakeLockManager'`;
- notification and lock-screen transport, showing the guide title and its
  context and never a media id;
- headset media buttons, from a Bluetooth headset's own button
  (`MediaKeyEvt pkg=com.android.bluetooth`), pause and play both ways;
- pausing instead of switching to the speaker when the headphones go away
  (`AS.AudioDeviceBroker: broadcast ACTION_AUDIO_BECOMING_NOISY`);
- AudioFocus in both cases the brief names: another app taking focus
  (`onAudioFocusChange(-1)` → pause) and an incoming call, which paused on the
  ring and **resumed on its own** when telecom abandoned focus;
- position persisted across `force-stop` and restored on the next play;
- a finished guide replaying from the start, not from its end;
- the whole flow with Wi-Fi and mobile data off — cold start, navigation and
  playback with `Active default network: none` and no IP route at all;
- the packaged placeholder WAV decoding natively at its own rate
  (`FormatInfo{channelMask=0x1, sampleRate=8000}`) for exactly 720 s
  (`duration = 720000 ms`), which the UI reads as `12:00`;
- the Activity being destroyed and recreated on rotation
  (`Checking to restart … changed={CONFIG_ORIENTATION}` →
  `finishDrawing of relaunch`) without interrupting the audio, because the
  controller lives on the application;
- tapping the notification returning to the task on the screen the traveller
  had left, with a single Activity instance in the task.

### Fixed after the device run

Three defects the device run found, all in how playback surfaces rather than in
playback itself, and all re-verified on the device afterwards:

- the compact player and fixed bars such as "Iniciar passeio" were drawn under
  the system navigation bar on every route without bottom navigation, because
  the only `navigationBars` inset lived inside `TcBottomNavigation`. The shell
  now reserves `WindowInsets.systemBars` once, for every route;
- the notification had no `contentIntent`, so tapping it did nothing.
  `setSessionActivity` now carries an immutable `PendingIntent` to
  `MainActivity` with `NEW_TASK or SINGLE_TOP` — `NEW_TASK` alone stacked a
  second Activity showing Hoje instead of resuming the screen in view;
- the notification and lock screen offered "Ir para o item anterior", which a
  single-item audioguide cannot honour. The player is now wrapped so it does
  not report the queue commands. Restricting the media notification
  controller's commands was not enough: `DefaultMediaNotificationProvider`
  builds its buttons from `player.getAvailableCommands()`, and media button
  preferences can only replace that button, never remove it.

### Reaching seek and chapters — decided

The capabilities are implemented and tested; what was missing was an *approved*
place to put them. The canonical 19 screens contain no solo full player:
screen 09 is **Ouvir juntos**, the shared player (Phase 4), screen 07 is Walk
Mode's transport (Phase 3), and the chapter list is part of screen 04 (Phase 6).

**Decision taken: option (a).** Seek and chapter selection are deferred to the
already-approved surfaces of Phases 3/4/6. No solo player screen is created,
and neither ±15 nor chapter selection is added to the compact player. Phase 2
ships play/pause as its reachable behaviour (D025).

### Audio content status

`trip/audio/attractions/bascarsija.prototype.wav` is a **synthetic placeholder**,
not a recording — origin, licence and replacement steps are in
`app/src/main/assets/trip/audio/README.md`. It runs the approved **720 s**, so
screen 05 reads "Ouvir audioguia · 12 min" exactly as the prototype specifies
and the stated duration matches the file on the device. Its three chapters are
marked by audible tones at 0 / 4 / 8 min; the titles are labelled as prototype
rather than posing as narration.

## Phase 3
- [ ] Walk Mode / location / stories

## Phase 4
- [ ] Firebase group synchronization

## Phase 5
- [ ] Voice memories

## Later
- [ ] Remaining canonical screens
- [ ] Weather (live/cached states; only the trip fallback exists today)
- [ ] Notifications
- [ ] Real Balkans package
- [ ] Full Trip Validator
- [ ] Real-device QA

## What runs today

```text
01 Quem é você?  →  02 Hoje  →  05 Atração
```

Destinations that belong to later phases (Dia completo, Documento/QR, Plano B,
Modo Passeio, Audioguia, Memória) exist in the navigation graph and open a
screen that names the canonical screen and its phase.

## Content pipeline (infrastructure only)

Isolated from the Android phases: nothing below changes what the app does or
which phase it is in.

- [x] Schema **1.1** — every local time names its IANA zone (D026). `city`,
      `day` and both transport endpoints require `timeZone`; a timeline item
      may override its day. Projected into `TripModels.kt`; the three packaged
      trips are migrated and stay on Sarajevo/Mostar content unchanged.
- [x] `trip-package/source/` (`itinerary/`, `user-notes/`, `private/`),
      `generated/` and `production/` exist as the pipeline skeleton.
      `production/` and `source/private/` are ignored except for the one file
      that keeps each folder in the repository (D027).
- [x] The authoring documents are integrated — `content/` (generator, style
      guide, fact-check rules, package spec, templates) and
      `tools/content_preflight.py` are in the repository and required by
      `tools/check_repo.py`. `content_preflight.py` shares its IANA time-zone
      check with `validate_trip.py` (`known_timezones()`) instead of
      duplicating it.
- [ ] No content has been generated, nothing has been promoted, and the
      runtime still reads only `app/src/main/assets/trip/` — integrating the
      authoring workflow and its checks did not change where the app loads
      content from.

## Content validation

`tools/validate_trip.py` now also checks what JSON Schema cannot: unresolved
references, duplicate IDs, `dayNumber` against the trip window, and documents
that declare `availableOffline` without a packaged file (D014). These are
warnings while `metadata.contentStatus` is prototype/draft and errors once it
is `production`. Every declared time zone against the tz database (D026) is
checked separately and always fails, prototype/draft included — a wrong zone
is a real defect regardless of how finished the package is. A missing tz
database is not a warning either: the validator stops (exit 2).
`tools/content_preflight.py` resolves the same check through
`validate_trip.known_timezones()` so the two scripts cannot disagree.

Currently reported for the packaged trip: the two ticket/voucher PDFs are
declared offline but their files are not packaged yet. The UI reflects this —
it does not badge them "Offline" (D013).

## Verification

`python tools/check_repo.py` · `python tools/validate_trip.py` ·
`python tools/content_preflight.py <package> --allow-incomplete-authoring-files`
(no generated package exists yet, so this is exercised against the runtime
and starter trips) · `python -m unittest tools/test_validate_trip.py` ·
`./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug lintDebug`

Unit tests: 76 passing. Lint: 0 errors, 25 warnings (dependency-hygiene
notices; no lint baseline is used). Instrumented/device tests: not run — no
emulator or device is available in this environment.
